h1. Important

Mingus is currently stable with pip 0.4 - with the recent update to pip 0.5 there have been install issues reported related to pulling from git repos.

h2. Quick Start

The quick start assumes basic familiarity with vitualenv, virtualenv wrapper.

* mkvirtualenv myblog --no-site-packages
* cd myblog
* easy_install pip
* git clone git://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus.git
* cd django-mingus/mingus
* pip install -r stable-requirements.txt
* ... wait a bit
* mv local_settings.py.template local_settings.py
* ./manage.py syncdb
* ./manage.py runserver

By default the theme is set to the Basic theme.

Django-Mingus also comes with 4 additional themes: Django(green), Minimal (black/white), Dark (black), Basic
(beige/red), JeffCroft (brown/pink). You can view them "here":http://www.flickr.com/photos/37875916@N07/tags/mingustheme/.

To switch "themes" just change this line in templates/base.html:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/themes/basic.css" type="text/css" media="all" charset="utf-8">

You'll notice the themes/basic.css text - change that to one of the existing themes ('django', 'minimal', 'jeffcroft', 'dark'), or edit away on your own!
